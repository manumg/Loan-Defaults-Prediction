# Loan-Defaults-Prediction
PROJECT DESCRIPTION

PROJECT ROADMAP
<br>The project is divided in two parts:
<br>1.Data Cleaning
<br>2.Exploratory Data Analysis
<br>3.Feature engineering & Feature selection
<br>4.Model creation & Model evaluation
<br>5.Conclusions

<br>The first two parts are developed in the EDA notebook, while the rest are developed in the Model Creation Notebook

OBJECTIVE
<br>Predicting loan defaults is critical for banks, aiding in risk management and resource allocation. Defaulted loans cause financial losses, operational disruptions, and can negatively affect a bank's credit risk profile. By employing predictive models, banks can assess loan risk, intervene early, allocate resources efficiently, manage portfolios strategically, and comply with regulatory requirements. This project focuses on creating a machine learning model to predict loan defaults, offering an advanced solution for efficient risk management and decision-making.

DATASET
<br>The dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hemanthsai7/loandefault (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hemanthsai7/loandefault).
